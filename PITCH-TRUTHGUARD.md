# The Pitch: TruthGuard 🛡️

## The One-Sentence Idea
> "A browser extension that can keep a user safe by warning when they are viewing fake news, misinformation, disinformation, scams and other harmful material."

## The Problem

In 2024, misinformation costs the global economy an estimated **$78 billion annually**. Users encounter:
- 500+ fake news articles shared on social media daily
- Phishing attempts that look increasingly legitimate
- Sophisticated scam pages that mimic trusted brands
- Propaganda disguised as news

**The average person cannot distinguish fake from real** - and existing solutions require technical knowledge or are too slow.

## The Solution: TruthGuard

A **free, privacy-first browser extension** that acts as your personal truth detector:

### How It Works
1. **Install in 10 seconds** - No accounts, no sign-ups
2. **Automatic scanning** - Every page analyzed in real-time
3. **Clear visual warnings** - Green (safe), yellow (caution), red (danger)
4. **Blocking overlays** - Stop dangerous pages before they load

### Detection Methods
- **Domain Reputation** - Known fake news sites flagged instantly
- **Pattern Analysis** - Detects scam phrases like "You've won!" or "Act now!"
- **Security Checks** - Flags non-HTTPS pages with password fields
- **Content Quality** - Identifies clickbait and sensationalism

### Privacy First
- **100% local** - No data leaves your device
- **No accounts** - Nothing to hack or leak

3. **Browser extensions are trusted** - 2 billion+ users already use them
4. **The tech is ready** - Pattern matching + ML can run locally in browsers

## Market Opportunity

- **3.5 billion** people use Chrome, Firefox, or Edge

2. **Premium** ($3/mo) - Advanced AI analysis, family protection
3. **Enterprise** - Corporate deployments, compliance reporting
